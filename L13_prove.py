# Lesson 13 Prove

# Function to calculate wind chill
def get_wind_chill(temp, wind_speed):
    pass

# function to covert C to F
def get_temp_in_fahr(temp_in_fahr):
    pass

# ask the user for a temp


# ask the user if temp is F/C

# if C then call the conver function

# Loop from 5 to 60 increment by 5
    # be sure to call the get_wind_chill function using F and wind speed
    # print the wind chill -- follow the assignment example
